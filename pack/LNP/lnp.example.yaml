# EXAMPLE SETTINGS FILE
#
# Copy or rename this file to lnp.yaml and edit it to configure the launcher.
#
# WARNING: This configuration file is in the YAML format. I've tried to keep it as simple as humanly possible.
#          Keep in mind however that the way things are indented is not only to make it nicely readable, but that
#          it is actually part of YAML's syntax!
#          See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML for more info.
#
# This example settings file is based around the following directory structure:
#
# <LNP install dir>
#   |
#   +- /df_34_11_win            (Dwarf Fortress is extracted here)
#   |  |
#   |  +- Dwarf Fortress.exe    (The Dwarf Fortress executable)
#   |  |
#   +- /LNP                     (Contains LNP-specific files and folders)
#   |  |
#   |  +- lnp.yaml              (This configuration file)
#   |  |
#   |  +- /lib                  (Contains libraries needed by the LNP executable)
#   |  |
#   |  +- /graphics             (Contains all graphics packs, one per directory; you're free to use any directory name you like)
#   |  |  |
#   |  |  +- /pack1
#   |  |  +- /pack2
#   |  |  |  ...
#   |  |  +- /packn
#   |  |
#   |  +- /keybinds             (Contains all keybinds, one per file; you're free to use any file name you like)
#   |  |  |
#   |  |  +- keybinds1.txt
#   |  |  +- keybinds2.txt
#   |  |  |  ...
#   |  |  +- keybindsn.txt
#   |  |
#   |  +- /utilities            (Contains all utilities, one per directory; you're free to use any directory name you like)
#   |     |
#   |     +- /utility1
#   |     |  |
#   |     |  + utility1.exe
#   |     |
#   |     +- /utility2
#   |     |  ...
#   |     +- /utilityn
#   |
#   +- lazy-newbpack-gui-0.5.3-SNAPSHOT.jar    (The LNP executable)

#
# The directory, relative to <LNP install dir> where Dwarf Fortress is installed.
#
dfDirectory: df_34_11_win

#
# The filenamename of Dwarf Fortress' executable
#
dfExecutable: Dwarf Fortress.exe

#
# Wether or not to start Dwarf Fortress using a terminal emulator. Set this to true on
# if you use DFHack, otherwise DFHack won't work correctly.
#
# If this is set to false, the executable configured in dfExecutable will be started directly.
# If this is set to true, Dwarf Fortress will be started using a terminal emulator. How this works
# is OS-dependant:
#
# - On Windows, DF will be started using the following command:
#   cmd /C <full path to dfExecutable>
#
# - On Linux, DF will be started using the following command:
#   <value of terminalPath> -e <full path to dfExecutable>
#
# - On MacOS, DF will be started using the following command:
#   open <full path to dfExecutable>
#
launchDfWithTerminal: true

#
# IMPORTANT: This setting is Linux only. On Windows and MacOS it will do nothing.
#
# The terminal emulator to use for starting DF and utilities. In this example I'm using xterm, which
# (as far as I know) should be a reasonably safe default, considering xterm seems to be installed 
# with many Linux distributions.
#
terminalPath: xterm

#   <value>            The value of the setting.
#
# The first setting you specify for each utility must be preceded with a minus (-) like the example below.
# The order of utilities in the launcher will be the same as specified in this config file.

# Start of the utilities section.

   showTerminal: false
   # [true/false] Wether or not to start the utility automatically when starting Dwarf Fortress.
